Objective

Your objective is to create your first react application with the create-react-app tool, and investigate the starter files you are given.

    This project repository will be used for all of the upcoming react exercises

Getting Started

This is part 1 of TrueCoders' React Exercise Series.

We will create a new react repository that you work in for the duration of the series.
Steps

React Series Part 1 has multiple exercises.

    Exercise 1: Create the Project
    Exercise 2: Open Visual Studio Code
    Exercise 3: Start the React Development Server
    Exercise 4: Update the App

Exercise 1: Create the Project

Create a react project with create-react-app

    Navigate to your repos/ folder (or other desired place where you keep your projects)
    Create a new react project by running npx create-react-app react-project in your terminal

Exercise 2: Open Visual Studio Code

Open the new react project in Visual Studio Code

    Open the app in VSCode.
    Take note of the templated file structure. Open some of the files to see what is there before you make any changes.

Exercise 3: Start the React Development Server

Start the development server to see the rendered output

    Start the create-react-app development server by running npm start in your terminal
    View the rendered output in the browser
        Running npm start should open your browser for you, but you can always access your development server by visiting
        http://localhost:3000
        in your browser

    Be sure to be at your react-project/ folder in your terminal before running npm start

Exercise 4: Update the App

Make changes!

    Open the src/App.js file
    Try to change the paragraph inner html from Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload. to React is so cool!
        Keep your eyes on the rendered output in the browser. It changes automatically!
    Add the following elements to the content in the App.js file. No specific order or structure required. Just see the elements updated on the DOM with the development server running.
        a heading 1 element
        another paragraph element
        an unordered list with 3 list items

We're going to be spending a lot of time in React, but for now, you've created a new React project with the create-react-app tool, investigated the template source code, started the React development server, and made some initial changes!s
